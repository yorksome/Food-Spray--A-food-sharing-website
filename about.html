       <h2>Who We Are</h2>

           <div class="panel-body">We are a group of students who are living in Durham in the UK, aiming at reducing food waste through food sharing. We create this website for those citizens to post their unwanted food.
             To be more specific, after signing up or signing into an account, a food owner could upload the description of the food to the system, so that the information of the food will be retrieved by other users. When users browse the food and show their interest in or need to it, they will be able to contact the food owner for details and pick up free food offline. This means that the unwanted food could be shared on this food sharing platform, contributing to reducing household food and drink waste. Moreover, in order to facilitate the conduct of food sharing, the system will provide functions, such as searching, filtering, sorting and adding to wish list to help users find their wanted food. And then users could pick up their food easily via functions such as messaging and location services that is supplied by the system.
